# CoilCollection

A collection of various coil wire geometries.

Running `CoilCollection.py` will:
- Display the coils in interactive 3D using Mayavi.
- Save screenshots and generate a `GALLERY.md`.
- Write the generated wire points to `.txt` files.

The `.txt` files can be loaded as wires in [MagnetiCalc](https://github.com/shredEngineer/MagnetiCalc).
